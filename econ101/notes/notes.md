What is Economics? {#cha:what_is_economics_}
==================

Wants and Scarcity {#sec:wants_and_scarcity}
------------------

Wants
:   economic problems arise because we desire (want) more than we can
    get.

Scarcity
:   scarcity is the inability to satisfy our wants.

Choices
:   we make choices in the face of scarcity.

Incentive
:   incentives are the reward (or threat) that encourages a choice to be
    made.

Economics {#sec:economics}
---------

Economics
:   study of how people choose to allocate their limited resources to
    satisfy their nearly unlimited wants.

    -   Essentially, this is human behavior.

Micro Economics
:   study of how people choose to allocate their limited resources to
    satisfy their nearly unlimited wants.

Macro Economics
:   is the study of the performance of the national and global
    economies.

There’s an underlying theme of “Two big questions” here, so I’m going to
riff on that a bit. It’s not in the book, so here we go:

Two Big Economic Questions Are:

1.  How do choices end up determining *what*, *how*, and *for whom* are
    goods and services produced? TODO: this needs to be cleaned up.

    1.  What?

        This question is answered with “Economics provides some answers
        to these questions”

    2.  How?

        Goods and Services
        :   are the objects that people value and produce to satisfy
            humans.

        1.  Goods and Services can be instrumented by the *factors of
            production*. Doing this shows us how they are created.
            $$Y = F ( L, T, K, H, A)$$ Where:

            1.  is the profit

            2.  is the labour

            3.  is the land (“gifts of nature”)

            4.  is the human capital

            5.  is technology

            6.  is the capital

    3.  What?

        1.  Land earns *rent*.

        2.  Labor earns *wages*.

        3.  Capital earns *interest*.

        4.  Entrepreneurship earns *profit*.

2.  When do choices made for *self-benefit* also promote
    *social-benefit*?

    People make decisions for self-benefit, but sometimes they come out
    working for social-benefit.

    Social interest is measured in both *efficiency* and *equity*.

    Efficiency
    :   is achieved when goods are used to produce goods & services
        cheaply and in perfect quantity.

    Equity
    :   is achieved when income equals are equal (socialism).

    We’d like to pose the question:

    Is it possible that when each one of us makes choices that are in
    our self-interest, it also turns out that these choices are also in
    the social interest?

3.  Economic Way of Thinking:

    -   A choice is a trade-off between what we want and what is
        attainable

    -   People make rational choices by comparing benefits and costs

    -   Benefit is what you gain from something

    -   Cost is what you must give up to get something

    -   Most choices are “how-much” choices made at the margin

    -   Choices respond to incentives

    Another way to put it: (she wrote this)

    1.  All economic questions arise because we want more than what we
        can get

    2.  Our inability to meet all our wants is called *scarcity*

    3.  Because we face *scarcity*, we make choices

    4.  The choices we make are influenced by the incentives we face

    5.  Choices involve *trade-offs*

    6.  People make rational choices by comparing benefits (MB) and
        costs (MC)

    Opportunity Cost
    :   is the best forgone alternative when you make a choice

        She used the example of her toddler that she doesn’t see when
        she teaches us.

        Ex: Cost of skipping University and going directly to the
        workforce.

          ---------------- ------------------- ------------
                Type              Name            Value
           Explicit Costs        Tuition        $8$ x [\$]
           Explicit Costs   Books & Materials   $8$ x [\$]
           Implicit Costs      Lost Salary      $4$ x [\$]
          ---------------- ------------------- ------------

        TODO: some of those should’ve been negative.

Positive & normative Statements {#sec:positive_&_normative_statements}
-------------------------------

Positive Statements
:   are statements about what is.

    -   Definite statements that can be checked against facts

Normative statements
:   are opinion-based statements about what *ought to* be.

    -   They cannot be tested

    -   XYZ is “too”…

    -   Everyone “should”…

Should be able to identify statements that are positive or normative.
Look for the words “should” or “ought”.

TODO: Format to put Choices and trade-offs in it’s own section. It was
in that “big economic questions” section

The Economic System and the Environment {#sec:the_economic_system_and_the_environment}
---------------------------------------

The environment provides to the economy goods and services, and the
economy uses these. As a byproduct, there is pollution and waste. In
Classic economy, we take this as a closed (unmodifiable) system.
Environmental economy disputes this.

Graphs in Economics {#sec:graphs_in_economics}
-------------------

We should be able to graph after doing this section. Also, correlation &
stuff.

### Economic Models {#sub:economic_models}

An abstraction from reality that consist of economic variables.

Three different types of graphs:

-   Time-series graphs (PT Metropolis OTS/TS)

-   Cross-section graphs

-   Scatter plots

Characterizing models: Assume models can be expressed as a function.

Positive Relationships
:   are when $\frac{dy}{dx} > 0$. i.e when the slope is positive.

Negative Relationships
:   are when $\frac{dy}{dx} < 0$. i.e when the slope is negative. Also
    known as inverse relationship.

Convex Curve
:   $|\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}| > 0$. i.e. the under-part creates a cave.

Concave Curve
:   $|\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}| < 0$ i.e. the under-part doesn’t create a cave.

Linear
:   (Curve) $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0$

Lines:

$$\begin{aligned}
                        y &= a + by
                    \end{aligned}$$

Where the parameters are: $a$ is the $y$-intercept and $b$ is the slope.

$$\begin{aligned}
                        \text{Slope} &= \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}} \\
                                     &= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
                    \end{aligned}$$

The Economic Problem {#cha:the_economic_problem}
====================

We care about the Production of Goods and services that rely on the
factors of production.

Production of goods and services,

1.  Inputs/factors of production

    $$\begin{aligned}
                            ( L, T, K, H, A)
                        \end{aligned}$$

2.  Existing technology, $A$

Opportunity Cost and Production Possibility Curve {#sec:opportunity_cost_and_production_possibility_curve}
-------------------------------------------------

Production Possibility Frontier
:   (PPF) shows all combinations of two goods producable using existing
    tech and available resources.

    i.e. the tradeoff between $n$ of $x$ vs $m$ of $y$ that you can make
    for a fixed total cost.

    Anything above the curve represents scarcity. Anything on the curve
    represents efficient resource use. Anything below the curve
    represents inefficiency, and is an opportunity (capitalism)

Production Efficiency
:   exist on all points on the frontier, where in order to produce one
    more of anything, we must produce one less of something else.

Inefficient Points
:   are the points under the PPF.

Tradeoffs
:   are made to move from one point on the PPF frontier to another.

Forgone
:   cost is that of the thing being omitted. The opportunity cost of
    something is the highest valued alternative foregone.

Marginal Cost
:   of a good or service is the opportunity of producing one more unit
    of it.

Preferences
:   are what people like and dislike

Marginal Benefit
:   of a good or service is the benefit received from consuming one or
    more unit of it. We measure this by what a person is willing to pay
    for it.

Principle of Decreasing Marginal Benefit
:   is that when we have more of any good, the smaller the marginal
    benefit is.

Marginal Benefit Curve
:   shows the relationship between the marginal benefit of a good, and
    when it is consumed.

Allocative Efficiency
:   is when we cannot produce more of anything without stopping
    producing something more important.

Technological Change
:   is when tech changes and effects how we can grow our economy.

Capital Accumulation
:   is the growth of capital resources.

**Sustainability** is a thorn in the thigh of environmental growth. It
is the American dream, that children will be better-off than their
parents.

Production Possibilities Frontier
:   (PPF) is the boundary between combinations of goods and services
    that can be produced.

Ceteris Paribus
:   means “all else remains the same” (except what we’re considering).
    See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus) for
    more.

We can talk about the different ontology of resources:

-   Depletable resources are resources that can be depleted

-   Renewable Resources are resources that are replenished naturally

-   Current reserves are resources that can be extracted at current
    prices

-   Potential reserves are resources that may be available at higher
    costs

-   Resource endowments is the natural occurrence of resources

Advantage {#sec:advantage}
---------

Comparative Advantage
:   is that a person can perform the activity at a lower opportunity
    cost than anyone else.

Absolute Advantage
:   is that the person is more productive than others.

Gains From Trade {#sec:gains_from_trade}
----------------

Learning-By-Doing
:   is when a body specializes by repeatedly doing (or producing) a good
    or service.

Dynamic Comparative Advantage
:   is what a body gains a comparative advantage by learning-by-doing.

Free v Fair Trade {#sec:free_v_fair_trade}
-----------------

Free trade allows traders to trade across boundaries without
interference from their respective governments.

Fair Trade
:   contributes to development by offering better trading conditions and
    securing rights.

Firm
:   is an economic unit that hires factors of production

Market
:   is any arrangement that enables buyers and sellers to interact

Property Rights
:   are the social arrangements that govern ownership, use, and disposal
    of resources

Money
:   is... money.

Demand and Supply {#cha:demand_and_supply}
=================

Prices act as incentives.

Demand
:   is the marginal benefit curve of the relationship between the
    willingness and ability to pay, correlating the price and quantity
    demanded.

Supply
:   is the marginal cost curve of the relationship between the price and
    the quantity supplied.

Competitive Markets
:   are markets that enough buyers and sellers so no single player can
    influence the price.

Money Price
:   is the number of dollars that must be given up for it.

Relative Price
:   is an opportunity cost, measured in terms of one money price to
    another. This is usually what we mean.

Supply and Demand {#sec:demand_curve}
-----------------

Quantity Demanded
:   $Q_d$ is the amount that consumers plan to buy at a given price.

Quantity supplied
:   $Q_s$ is the amount that producers can produce at a given price.

The **Law of Demand** states that the higher a price $P$ of a good is,
the smaller the quantity that is demanded $Q_d$; same with vice versa.

Substitution Effect
:   dictates that as the price of a good increases people seek
    substitutes; this causes quantity demanded to decrease.

Income Effect
:   dictates that as a price increases relative to income it becomes
    un-affordable; this causes quantity demand to decrease.

When the price goes up, $Q_d$ decreases, and $Q_s$ increases. Same with
vice versa.

The **Demand Curve** is the $\approx \frac{1}{x}$ curve that shows the
relationship between the quantity demanded and its price; this can be
tabulated in a *Demand schedule* instead of a graph.

Six main factors that change demand are:

-   Prices of related goods

-   Expected future prices

-   Income

-   Expected future income and credit

-   Population

-   Preferences

A *substitute* is a good that can be substituted, and a *complement* is
a good that can be used in conjunction with another good.

We can categorize **normal goods** as goods that increase in demand as
income increases. Goods that have demand decrease are named **inferior
goods**.

**Supply** reflects a decision about which items were produced.

Quantity Supplied
:   of a good or service is the amount that producers plan to sell in a
    given time period.

The **Law of Supply** states:

Other things remaining the same, a price $P$ increase leads to a
increased $Q_s$. Similarly, reducing the price $P$ causes $Q_s$ to
decrease as well.

The **Supply Curve** is the $\approx x^2$ curve that shows the
relationship between the quantity supplied and its price; this can be
tabulated in a *Supply Schedule* instead of a graph.

The lowest price that would be supplied is called the *marginal cost*.

Equilibrium - Price and Quantity {#sec:equilibrium_price_and_quantity}
--------------------------------

Equilibrium Price
:   is the price at the intersection of demanded quantity and quantity
    supplied.

Equilibrium Quantity
:   is the quantity bought and sold at the equilibrium price.

Having a price above the equilibrium price creates a surplus that forces
the price down. Having a price below the equilibrium price creates a
shortage that forces the price up. Modifying the Supply Curve or the
demand curve modifies the different locations of the Equilibrium point.
Be smart and think - you can predict where it ends up.

Elasticity {#cha:elasticity}
==========

Price Elasticity of Demand and Supply {#sec:price_elasticity_of_demand_and_supply}
-------------------------------------

Price Elasticity of Demand
:   measures how demanders respond to a change in the price of a good,
    and how changes will affect price and quantity demanded.

Income Elasticity of Demand
:   measures how demanders respond to a change in income

Cross Elasticity of Demand
:   measures how strongly demanders respond to the change in the price
    of another good.

Price Elasticity of Supply
:   measures how strongly suppliers respond to a change in the price of
    a good.

Price Elasticity of demand
:   is a units-free measure of the responsiveness of the quantity
    demanded of a good to a change in its price, *ceteris paribus*.

In general, **elasticity measures responsiveness**. It effectively
measures how much demanders respond to a variable price.

We can calculate elasticity as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
                    \frac{\text{\% change in quantity demanded}}{\text{\% change in price}}
                \end{aligned}$$

-   We express the change in price as a percentage of the *average
    price* - the average of the initial and the new price.

-   We express the change in the quantity demanded as a percentage of
    the *average quantity demanded* - the average of the initial and new
    quantity.

By using the **average price** and the **average quantity**, we get the
same elasticity value regardless of whether the price rises or falls.

1.  The ratio of two proportionate changes is the same as the ratio of
    two percentage changes.

2.  The measure is units free.

3.  The demand elasticity formula is negative because price and quantity
    move in different directions. This means we get to use
    magnitude/absolute value of the **price elasticity of demand**. We
    don’t measure slope because the units may change (i.e. cents $\to$
    \$).

Inelastic Demand
:   is when the quantity demanded doesn’t change when the price changes.
    Price Elasticity of demand $< 1$ is *inelastic demand*. The demand
    curve is completely vertical.

Elastic Demand
:   is non-inelastic demand. Price Elasticity of demand $> 1$ is
    *elastic demand*.

Perfectly Elastic Demand
:   is when the price elasticity of demand is $\infty$.

Relationship Between Price Elasticity of Demand and Total Revenue {#sec:relationship_between_price_elasticity_of_demand_and_total_revenue}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Total Revenue
:   from the sale of goods or services is the price of good multiplied
    by the quantity sold.

-   *Elastic* demand means that a 1% price cut increases quantity sold
    by $> 1 \%$, so total revenue increases.

-   *Inelastic* demand means that a 1% price cut increases quantity sold
    by $< 1 \%$, so total revenue decreases.

-   *Unit Elastic* demand means that a 1% price cut increases quantity
    sold by exactly$ 1 \%$, so total revenue stays the same.

Total Revenue Test
:   is a method of estimating the price elasticity of demand from the
    change in total revenue from a price change. Basically, we
    reverse-engineer the $\delta$revenue to find the type of demand.

We can influence the elasticity of demand using one of these three:

-   Closeness of substitutes.

    When substitutes are closer to the real deal, the more elastic the
    demand is.

-   Proportion of income spent on the good.

    The larger the proportion of income consumers spend on a good, the
    larger the elasticity of demand.

-   The time since the last price change.

    The more time that consumers have to adjust to a price change, or
    the longer it can be stored without losing value, the more elastic
    the demand is for the good.

Cross Elasticity of Demand and Income Elasticity of Demand {#sec:cross_elasticity_of_demand_and_income_elasticity_of_demand}
----------------------------------------------------------

The **cross elasticity of demand** is a measure of how responsive the
demand for a good is to the change of the price of a substitute or
complement.

We can calculate it as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
                    \frac{\text{
                    \% change in quantity demanded
                    }}{\text{
                    \% change in price of substitute or complement
                    }}
                \end{aligned}$$

In general, the cross elasticity is signed. For a **substitute**, it’s
positive. For a **complement**, it’s negative.

As the price of a substitute rises, the quantity of the product rises.
As the price of a complement rises, the quantity of the product
decreases.

The **Income of Demand** measures how quantity demanded responds to a
change in income.

It can be calculated as:

$$\begin{aligned}
                    \frac{\text{
                    \% change in quantity demanded
                    }}{\text{
                    \% change of income
                    }}
                \end{aligned}$$

Income Elastic
:   goods have elasticity of demand $>1$, and are *normal goods*

Income Inelastic
:   goods have elasticity of demand is in $0<1$, and are *normal goods*

Inferior Goods
:   goods have elasticity of demand of $<0$.

The **elasticity of supply** measures the how quantity supplied responds
to a change in price of a good.

It can be calculated as:

$$\begin{aligned}
                    \frac{\text{
                    \% change in quantity supplied
                    }}{\text{
                    \% change in price
                    }}
                \end{aligned}$$

Perfectly Inelastic
:   supplyis if the supply curve is vertical and the elasticity of
    supply is $0$

Unit Elastic
:   supply is if the supply curve is linear and passes through the
    origin

Perfectly Elastic
:   supply is horizontal and the elasticity of supply is infinite.

The elasticity of supply depends on:

-   Resource substitution possibilities

-   Time frame for supply decision

What happens when the price of a good changes? How does it impact
another group. (that’s cross elasticity of demand).

If I increase Pepsi by 10%, the quantity requested by Coca-Cola will go
up. Coca-Cola is a substitute for Pepsi.

The more time that passes after a price change, the greater the
elasticity of supply is.

Momentary Supply
:   is perfectly inelastic - there is no change to supply as the price
    changes. This is the period of time immediately after a price
    change.

Short-run Supply
:   is somewhat inelastic. It is how the quantity responds to a price
    change when only some tech adjustments are made.

Long-run Supply
:   is the most elastic. It is the asymptotic behavior once all
    adjustments are made.

Utility & Demand {#cha:utility_&_demand}
================

“Marginal utility theory” can be used derive the downward-sloping demand
curve. It also explains the factors that change demand. Finally, the
theory also reinforces the power of marginal analysis in determining the
utility-maximizing allocation of consumer budgets.

Consumer’s Choice {#sec:consumer_s_choice}
-----------------

Consumers choices are limited by income, and can only buy goods they can
afford. They have choices within their financial ability. Consumers will
generally choose the combinations of goods and services that maximizes
their utility.

### Total Utility {#sub:total_utility}

Total Utility
:   is the benefit a person gets from consuming goods. The more that
    people consume, the higher the utility is.

### Cardinal and Ordinal Utility Theory {#sub:cardinal_and_ordinal_utility_theory}

Cardinal Utility
:   is an antiquated system that numerically evaluates the **utility**
    of objects in a unit named the **util**.

Ordinal Utility
:   is a (modern) system where utility of goods are compared (and are
    therefore preferred). Magnitudes of difference has no meaning.

Utilitarianism
:   is the doctrine that dictates that maximization of utility is a
    moral criterion to organize society.

### Maximizing Utility {#sub:maximizing_utility}

Marginal Utility
:   is the change in total utility that results from a one-unit change
    in the volume consumed of a good. Essentially, there is a
    *diminishing marginal utility* of consuming more and more of a good.

Marginal Utility Theory {#sec:marginal_utility_theory}
-----------------------

The theory postulates that houses chooses the consumption possibility
permutation that maximizes their total utility. We call this chosen
combination the **consumer equilibrium**.

### Maximizing Utility {#sub:maximizing_utility}

Marginal Utility Per Dollar
:   is the marginal utility of a good divided by its price. In other
    words, it’s the obtained utility of a good by spending an extra
    dollar.

### Utility-Maximizing Rule {#sub:utility_maximizing_rule}

For good $x$, we call the marginal utility $MU_x$, and the price $P_x$.

The marginal utility per dollar is:

$$\begin{aligned}
                        \frac{MU_x}{P_x}
                    \end{aligned}$$

When choosing between two goods, we want to pick choices to maximize the
amount spent where $\frac{MU_a}{P_a} = \frac{MU_b}{P_b}$.

If $\frac{MU_a}{P_a} > \frac{MU_b}{P_b}$, then we are spending too much
on $b$ and not enough on $a$.

Generally, we want t equalize the two marginal utilities per dollar.

### Marginal Utility Theory {#sub:marginal_utility_theory}

Marginal Theory Predicts the change of demand:

-   A fall in the price of a substitute decreases a demand in the good
    being substituted out.

-   A rise in income increases the demand for normal goods.

### New Budget Equation {#sub:new_budget_equation}

In 2-dimensional budgets, we can express budget constraints as the
following equation:

$$\begin{aligned}
                        P_\alpha Q_\alpha + P_\beta Q_\beta = Y
                    \end{aligned}$$

Where $P_x$ and $Q_x$ are the price and quantity of good $x$ sold,
respectively.

### Algorithm for Decision Making Using Marginal Utility {#sub:algorithm_for_decision_making_using_marginal_utility}

Given the table below,

[h]

<span> | l | l | l || l | l | l | </span> Quantity & MU &
$\frac{MU}{\$}$ & Quantity & MU & $\frac{MU}{\$}$\
4 & 28 & 7.00 & 10 & 5 & 1.25\
5 & 26 & 6.50 & 9 & 7 & 1.75\
6 & 24 & 6.00 & 8 & 10 & 2.50\
7 & 22 & 5.50 & 7 & 13 & 3.25\
8 & 20 & 5.00 & 6 & 20 & 5.00\
9 & 17 & 4.25 & 5 & 22 & 5.50\
10 & 16 & 4.00 & 4 & 24 & 6.00\

we begin iterating from 0 of each element, and choose the element that
gives us (for each value) the best marginal utility per dollar. [^1]

### Predictions From Marginal Utility Theory {#sub:predictions_from_marginal_utility_theory}

Well, we can tell a few things using that graph I referred to earlier:

-   As the price decreases, the marginal utility per dollar increases.
    More of that item will be purchased.[^2]

-   As the amount available to spend[^3] increases, the amount purchased
    will increase.[^4]

Paradox of value {#sec:paradox_of_value}
----------------

### Surplus {#sub:surplus}

We can define two variables to do with surplus as follows:

PS
:   is the Producer Surplus - the difference between what producers
    receive for sale of a good and (the minimum) they’d choose to accept
    when selling a good.

CS
:   is the Consumer Surplus - the difference between what consumers pay
    for of a good and (the maximum of) what they’d choose to pay when
    selling a good.

For either party, this is the “money surplus” after a transaction.

### Paradox of Value {#sub:paradox_of_value}

Simply put, when the marginal utility of an item is large, so too will
be the cost.

For example, the marginal utility of diamonds is large, so even though
the total utility is small, their price is high. Similarly, the marginal
utility of water is small, so even though the total utility is large,
their price is low.

In terms of marginal utility per dollar, the two are the same.

Overconsumption and Social Norms {#sec:overconsumption_and_social_norms}
--------------------------------

### Behavioral Economics {#sub:behavioral_economics}

Behavioral Economics studies the brain’s (in)ability to rationalize
economic decisions, and how these influence the markets. There are three
impediments to rational choice:

Bounded Rationality
:   is the heuristics used when faced with uncertainty.

Bounded Will-Power
:   is the sub-optimal will-power that prevents us from making decisions
    that we know are wrong and will regret.

Bounded Self-Interest
:   is the self-interest that allows us to suppress helping others.

### Some Behaviours {#sub:some_behaviours}

Here are a few effects observed by economists:

Endowment Effect
:   is the tendency for people to value something more highly because
    they own it.

Neuro-Economics
:   is the study of how the brain operates during economic decision
    making.

Controversy
:   exists in economics between the role of economics in the future. One
    group believes it should be in examining **how** decisions are made.
    Another group believes it should be in examining **the effect** of
    decisions on the market.

### Over-Consumption and Social Norms {#sub:over_consumption_and_social_norms}

In traditional economics and in times of scarcity, more is better than
less. Since the environmental impact needs to be considered, this isn’t
always true.

One could stipulate that an equation exists as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
                        \text{Environmental Impact} &= (\text{Population})(\text{Affluence})(\text{Technology})
                    \end{aligned}$$

Where:

Population
:   is the number of people

Affluence
:   is measured in terms of wealth per person

Technology
:   is measured in environmental impact per dollar.

Ecologically speaking, if technology can’t keep up with affluence and
population, we’re `(@*\$&`’d.

### Easterlin Paradox {#sub:easterlin_paradox}

The **Easterlin Paradox** prescribes that income and happiness are
positively related, but the derivative of happiness is negative. [^5]

### Social Motives for Consumption {#sub:social_motives_for_consumption}

We can say that consumption is effected by a few social motives:

Bandwagon Effect
:   is the desire to consume because others do too.

Snob Effect
:   is the desire to consume because others do not.

Veblen Effect
:   is the effect of buying something due to the prestige that comes
    with buying it.

Possibilities, Preferences, and Choices {#cha:possibilities_preferences_and_choices}
=======================================

Preferences and Indifference Curve {#sec:preferences_and_indifference_curve}
----------------------------------

### Preferences and Indifference Curve {#sub:preferences_and_indifference_curve}

We can define an indifference curve as $f(x) \alpha \frac{1}{x}$. All
points above the curve are preferred to points on (and below) the
indifference curve. A consumer is Indifferent to all points on one
curve.

A **preference map** is a series of indifference curves, almost like a
gradient field.

The slope at any point of an indifference curve is the **marginal rate
of substitution** - i.e. the rate that the consumer is willing to trade
one good for another.

### Marginal Rate of Substitution {#sub:marginal_rate_of_substitution}

The rate a person is willing to give up good $y$ to get an additional
good $x$ while remaining indifferent is called the **marginal rate of
substitution** (MRS).[^6]

The fact that the MRS decreases as we increase $x$ (i.e.
$\lim_{x \to \infty}$) is called the **diminishing marginal rate of
substitution** - i.e. that the marginal rate of substitution diminishes.

### Degree of Substitutability {#sub:degree_of_substitutability}

The shape of indifference curves reveals the amount that two goods can
be substituted for each other. We can categorize these as follows:

Perfect Substitutes
:   are substances that consumers are willing to substitute for one
    another at a constant rate.[^7] This is categorized by the equation
    for the utility:

    $$\begin{aligned}
                                U(x, y) &= ax + by
                            \end{aligned}$$

Perfect Complements
:   are goods that are consumed in fixed proportions together.[^8] They
    can be characterized by the utility equation:

    $$\begin{aligned}
                                U(x, y) &= \min(ax, by)
                            \end{aligned}$$

Budget Schedule and Budget Line {#sec:budget_schedule_and_budget_line}
-------------------------------

### Budget Line {#sub:budget_line}

A **budget line** describes the limit to an organism’s consumption
choices. Generally, the line is of the form of $y = mx + b$, where
$m < 0$ and $b > 0$. A valid choice is any point at or below[^9] the
line, and invalid ones are above the line[^10].

Divisible Goods
:   can be bought at any point in a line (i.e. 3.564345 lb of flour)

Indivisible Goods
:   can be bought at integer points in a line (i.e. 4.0000 cars)

### Budget Equation {#sub:budget_equation}

In an efficient budget, we get the following:

$$\begin{aligned}
                        \text{Expenditure} &= \text{Income}
                    \end{aligned}$$

If your only expenditure was movies and pop, this equation would look
like (from prior):

$$\begin{aligned}
                        P_P Q_P + P_M Q_M &= Y \\
                        Q_P &= \frac{Y}{P_P} - \frac{P_M}{P_P}Q_M
                    \end{aligned}$$

Equivalently, expressing $Q_P$ as the second line allows us to define
the following terms:

Real Income
:   in terms of pop is $\frac{Y}{P_P}$. Equivalently, this is the point
    on the budget line where it meets the $y$-axis (assuming $y$ is for
    Pop).

Relative Price
:   of a movie in terms of pop is $\frac{P_M}{P_P}$. Equivalently, this
    is the magnitude of the slope of the budget line. It shows us how
    many pops must be forgone for one movie.

Since the **relative price** is an **opportunity cost**, the relative
price of a movie in terms of pops gives us the opportunity cost of a
movie in terms of pops forgone.

**Changes of Price** modify the slope of the budget line and the
intercept of the line that the item being changed is plotted on. [^11]

**Changes of Income** move the budget line to a parallel line that
represents less or more money.

Deriving an Individuals Demand Curve to Predict Choices {#sec:deriving_an_individuals_demand_curve_to_predict_choices}
-------------------------------------------------------

Efficient people tend to make the best choice by picking something on
the budget line that is on the highest attainable indifference curve.
Usually it follows that the marginal rate of substitution between the
two goods is equal to the relative price of the two goods.[^12]

We know that the **MRS** is a measure of how much someone is willing to
give up a good. Similarly, the **Relative Price** of two goods shows how
much the user must give up of one good to get another.

When the two are equal, the consumer is just[^13] willing to give up
what they must give up to improve.

### Changes in Price {#sub:changes_in_price}

Changes of price is called the **Price Effect**[^14].

During price changes, the indifference curves don’t change, but the
budget line rotates.

For normal goods, falling prices always increase the quantity consumed.

For inferior goods, increasing income leads to a decrease in quantity
consumed.

### Changes on Income {#sub:changes_on_income}

Changes of price is called the **Income Effect**[^15].

During price changes, the indifference curves don’t change, but the
budget strafes sideways.

### Substitution Effect {#sub:substitution_effect}

The **Substitution Effect** is how a change in price modifies the
quantity of items bought and the consumer remains on the same
indifference curve.[^16] This means that when the relative price falls,
the consumer always substitutes more of that good for others.

### Income Effect {#sub:income_effect}

As income increases, **Income Effect** implies that we can move from one
indifference curve to another.

For normal goods, the income effect reinforces the substitution effect
and is the second reason why the demand curve slopes downward.

Work-Leisure Choices {#sec:work_leisure_choices}
--------------------

We can apply this thinking to the decision between the “goods” of work
and leisure.

You buy leisure by not supplying labor and by forgoing income. The
“price” of leisure is the wage rate forgone.

By changing the wage rate, we can find a person’s labor supply curve. By
increasing the wage, the substitution effect makes leisure more
expensive and the person tends not to take leisure.

As wages increase, we choose different indifference curves to attain. In
fact, once wages increase past a certain point, people decide to spend
less time at work[^17].

Organizing Production {#cha:organizing_production}
=====================

Firms {#sec:firms}
-----

We’re learning about how decisions are made by firms, and how they
affect society. The sole objective of a firm is maximizing profit; the
incentive of elimination or of acquisition drives this objective.

Explicit and Implicit Cost {#sec:explicit_and_implicit_cost}
--------------------------

Profit is the difference between total revenue ($TR$) and total cost
($TR$).

$$\begin{aligned}
                    \text{Profit} &= \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \\
                    &= TR - TC \\
                    TR &= P_x Q_x
                \end{aligned}$$

There is a difference between accounting profit and economic profit.

Accounting Profit
:   is the firm’s revenues minus expenses and deprecation.

Economic Profit
:   is the total revenue minus total cost, where the total cost is
    measured as the opportunity cost of production.

### Economic Cost of Production {#sub:economic_cost_of_production}

The opportunity cost of production is the value of the best alternative,
expressed in money.

The opportunity cost of production is the sum of the cost of resources:

1.  Bought in the market - since the alternative is having cold, hard
    cash.

2.  Owned by the firm - since they implicitly rent it from themselves.
    This rate is effectively economic deprecation and interest forgone.

3.  Supplied by the firm’s owner - since the owner supplies
    entrepreneurship || labor, this is how much they’re losing through
    labor and expected entrepreneurship profit[^18]

### Firm Decision Making Process {#sub:firm_decision_making_process}

Firms must make five basic decisions to maximize profit:

1.  What/how much to produce

2.  How to produce

3.  How to organize and compensate managers and workers

4.  How to market and price products

5.  What to produce, and what to buy from other firms[^19]

Similarly, a firm has the constraints of:

Technology
:   constrains what firms can accomplish using their capital and
    labor[^20].

Information
:   occludes what data a firm can use to predict the future.

Market
:   constrains the firm by what customers willing to pay, and the
    efforts of other firms.

Technological and Economic Efficiency {#sec:technological_and_economic_efficiency}
-------------------------------------

**Tech Efficiency** is the phenomenon that occurs when a firm produces a
specified level of output by using minimal inputs. Better stated, a
technology $A$ is inefficient if at least one other technology $B$ is
“less expensive” than $A$ in at least one input, and is equal in all
other inputs.

**Economic Efficiency** is the phenomenon that occurs when a firm
produces a given output at minimal cost, comparing the relative costs of
capital and labor.

All economically efficient production processes are technologically
efficient. The reverse is not true.

### Information and Organization {#sub:information_and_organization}

Firms organize production by allocating resources using these two
systems:

Command Systems
:   are rigid tree-like system to pass commands to sub-systems. These
    are better when it is easy to monitor individual performance.

Incentive Systems
:   are systems that use market mechanisms to *convince* individual
    workers to maximize the firm’s profit. These are better when it is
    hard to monitor individual performance.

### Principal-Agent Problem {#sub:principal_agent_problem}

The problem of devising compensation rules to induce an agent to act in
the interests of a principal[^21] is named the **Principal-Agent
Problem**.

We can solve this problem with a combination of:

Ownership
:   of the firm incentivizes agents to operate efficiently, by
    converting them to principals as well.

Incentive Pay
:   links individual compensation (and therefore goals) to the monetary
    success of the firm.

Long-Term Contracts
:   ties agents long-term awards to the long-term performance of the
    firm.

### Business Types {#sub:business_types}

There are three types of businesses:

Sole Proprietorships
:   are a type of firm where a single owner has *unlimited liability*
    for all debts of the firm.

Partnerships
:   are a type of firm where two or more owners have *unlimited
    liability* and an agreed upon management and profit division
    structures.

Corporations
:   are a type of firm owned by one or more stockholders who are only
    liable for the amount of their initial investment[^22]

Markets and the Competitive Environment {#sec:markets_and_the_competitive_environment}
---------------------------------------

Market Types {#sec:market_types}
------------

Perfect Competition
:   is where there are *many* *indistinguishable* firms selling
    *identical products* to *many buyers* with *low entry costs* and no
    *occlusion*.

Monopolistic Competition
:   is when there are *many* firms that produce marginally
    *differentiated products* and has a *small amount of market power*.

Oligopoly
:   is when there are a *small number* of firms producing products in a
    market with *barriers to entry*.

Monopoly
:   is when all output is *produced by one firm* with *no close
    substitutes* and *high barriers to entry*.

### Market Concentration {#sub:market_concentration}

We can evaluate market concentration using two measures:

Four-Firm Concentration Ratio
:   is the percentage of total industry sales accounted for by the four
    largest firms.

Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
:   (HHI) is the square percentage market share $MS_x$ of each firm $x$
    over the largest $50$ firms in the industry.

    $$\begin{aligned}
                                    \text{HHI} &=
                                    \frac{\sum{MS_x^2}}{\sum_{r \in \text { top 50 firms in the industry.}}{MS_r}}
                                \end{aligned}$$

    Lower scores $~0$ imply highly competitive markets. Higher scores
    $~10,000$ imply a monopoly.

While the above methods establish a good measure of concentration, they
fail to address geographical scope, barriers to entry, and the
correspondence between the market and firms in the industry.

### Markets vs Firms {#sub:markets_vs_firms}

Firms coordinate production more effectively than markets since they are
driven by efficiency gains vs the market. [^23]

Firms can capitalize on:

-   Lower transactional costs

-   Economies of scale

-   Economies of scope

-   Economies of team production

Sustainable Business and Green Business {#sec:sustainable_business_and_green_business}
---------------------------------------

Sustainable businesses are ones that have no negative impact on global
or local:

-   Environment

-   Community

-   Society

-   Economy

Sustainable businesses are ones that meet the needs of current society
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs.

### Triple Bottom Line {#sub:triple_bottom_line}

“People, planet and profit” succinctly describes the triple bottom line
and the goal of sustainability.

Profit
:   is the real economic impact that the organization has on its
    economic environment

Planet
:   is the sustainable practices that protect and ensure that natural
    capital is available in the future.

People
:   are the fair and beneficial business practices toward labor,
    community, and the region of the business.

Output and Costs {#cha:output_and_costs}
================

Firms make decisions to **maximize profit**.

Laws of Production {#sec:laws_of_production}
------------------

The factors of production are termed the firm’s **plant**.

### Short Run {#sub:short_run}

In the **short run**, the plant is fixed.

Other resources (labor, raw materials, energy, etc) can be changed in
the short run. Decisions to change things in the short run are easily
reversed.

### Long Run {#sub:long_run}

The **long run** is the time frame in which the quantities of all
resources can be varied. These decisions are generally irreversible, and
involve **sunk cost**s that cannot be changed[^24]

### Sunk Cost {#sub:sunk_cost}

Behavioral Economics predicts that sunk costs affect actors decisions,
since humans are loss aversive and act irrationally.

The **sunk cost fallacy** is the irrational decisions that humans make
because they feel obliged to take advantage of opportunities that are
accidentally yield of sunk costs. Colloquially, this is known as
*throwing good money after bad*.

Product Curves {#sec:product_curves}
--------------

To increase *short run* output, a firm must increase the variable amount
of labor employed. Three concepts define the relationship between output
and quantity of labor:

-   Total Product

-   Marginal Product

-   Average Product

We can create graphs[^25] of how the different products above change
with respect to labor employed.

### Total Product Curve {#sub:total_product_curve}

The **Total Product** ($TP$ or $Q$) is the total output produced in a
given period.

The curve for this “product” evaluates production wrt labor employed.
Points below the line are attainable but inefficient; points above the
line are unattainable. Points on the line are efficient and attainable.

### Marginal Product Curve {#sub:marginal_product_curve}

The **Marginal Product** ($MP$, $\delta TP/\delta L$ or
$\delta Q/ \delta L$) of labor is the change in total product that by
increasing labor employed by one.

As with all marginal `xyz`’s, this curve is effectively the derivative
of the total product curve. Initially, there are increasing marginal
returns, but there are diminishing marginal returns past a certain
point.

The increase is due to a specialization and a division of labor[^26].

The diminishing return arises from the lack of capital and space to work
in.

#### Law of Diminishing Return {#ssub:law_of_diminishing_return}

The law of diminishing returns states:

> As a firm uses more of a variable input with a given quantity of fixed
> inputs, the marginal product of the variable input *eventually
> diminishes*.

### Average Product Curve {#sub:average_product_curve}

The **Average Product** of labor is equal to the average product per
quantity of labor employed[^27].

Short Run Cost Curves {#sec:short_run_cost_curves}
---------------------

We describe how cost changes as total product changes using three
concepts and types of cost curves:

-   Total Cost

-   Marginal Cost

-   Average Cost

### Total Cost Curve {#sub:total_cost_curve}

Total cost $TC$ is the cost of *all* resources used. This is broken into
fixed cost ($TFC$) which is the fixed inputs for all output quantities,
and variable cost ($TVC$) which is the variable inputs that change with
output quantities.

$$\begin{aligned}
                        TC &= TFC + TVC
                    \end{aligned}$$

### Marginal Cost Curves {#sub:marginal_cost_curves}

The **Marginal Cost** ($MC$) is the increase in cost that results from a
one-unit increase in total product. Over a range with **increasing
marginal returns**, marginal cost falls as output increases due to
specialization. Over a range with **decreasing marginal returns**,
marginal cost rises as output increases.

### Average Total Cost Curve {#sub:average_cost_curve}

The average total cost is expressed as $ATC$. Similar to *total cost*,
average cost can be separated into **average fixed cost** ($AFC$) and
**average variable cost** ($AVC$). Similar to total cost,

$$\begin{aligned}
                        ATC &= AFC + AVC
                    \end{aligned}$$

### Short-Run Cost {#sub:short_run_cost}

A corollary of diminishing return is that output produced by any new
worker is successively smaller.

### The Affects of Technology on Cost and Productivity Curves {#sub:the_affects_of_technology_on_cost_and_productivity_curves}

Technological change influences both productivity and cost curves.

Increasing productivity shifts all product curves upward, and cost
curves downward.

If tech increases capital and reduces the labor needed, fixed costs
increase increase and variable costs decrease.

### The Affects of Prices of Factors of Production on Cost and Productivity Curves {#sub:the_affects_of_prices_of_factors_of_production_on_cost_and_productivity_curves}

Increasing *fixed* cost increases $TC$, and $ATC$, but $MC$ remains the
same.

Increasing *variable* cost increases $TC$, $ATC$, and $MC$ curves
upward.

Long Run Cost Curves {#sec:long_run_cost_curves}
--------------------

### Production Function {#sub:production_function}

The long-run cost depends on a **production function** defined as the
relationship between the maximum output attainable and the quantities of
labor and capital available.

### Diminishing Marginal Product of Capital {#sub:diminishing_marginal_product_capital}

The **marginal product of capital** is the increase in output resulting
from an increase in the amount of capital employed with a constant
amount of labor.

### Average Cost Curve {#sub:average_cost_curve}

The long-run average cost curve is a planning curve which option
minimizes cost of producing a given output range.

### Doing Things at Scale {#sub:doing_things_at_scale}

Economies of Scale
:   are features of technology that lead to a falling long-run average
    cost as output increases.

Diseconomies of Scale
:   are features of technology that lead to an increasing long-run
    average cost as output increases.

Constant Returns to Scale
:   are features of technology that lead to a constant long-run average
    cost as output increases.

### Minimum Efficient Scale {#sub:minimum_efficient_scale}

The minimum efficient scale is the smallest quantity of output at which
the long-run average cost reaches its lowest level. If the Long-Run
average cost has a minimum cost, this is it.

Perfect Competition {#cha:perfect_competition}
===================

To study competitive markets, we need to see what happens when
competition is as fierce and extreme as possible. We say that these
markets display **Perfect Competition**.

There are a few types of markets:

-   Perfect Competition

-   Monopolistic Competition (TODO: Ref this)

-   Oligopoly (TODO: Ref this)

-   Monopoly (See Chapter [cha:monopoly])

Characteristics of Perfect Competition {#sec:characteristics_of_perfect_competition}
--------------------------------------

Perfect competition occurs in an industry where there is:

-   Many firms sell identical products to many buyers.

-   There are no restrictions on entry to the industry.

-   Established firms have no advantages over new ones.

-   Sellers and Buyers are well informed on pricing and products of all
    firms in the industry.

Firms who are in perfect competition face the maximal amount of
competition through the many competing firms, each of which produces an
identical product.

### How Perfect Competition Arises {#sub:how_perfect_competition_arises}

Perfect competition arises when both these conditions are met:

-   Firm’s minimum efficient scale is small relative to the market
    demand. We know that the minimum efficient scale is the smallest
    output level at which the LRAC[^28] reaches the minimum.

-   Each firm produce indistinguishable products.

### Price Takers {#sub:price_takers}

**Price Takers** are firms that cannot individually influence the price
of a good or service.

In a market with perfect competition, all firms are price takers.

### Economic Profit and Revenue {#sub:economic_profit_and_revenue}

The main goal of a firm is to maximize **economic profit**, which is
revenue less cost.

The total cost is the opportunity cost of production, which includes
normal profit.

i.e.:

$$\begin{aligned}
                        \text{economic profit} &= \text{total revenue} - \text{total cost} \\
                        \text{total cost} &= \text{opportunity cost of production} \\
                        \text{total revenue} &= (\text{price})(\text{quantity}) \\
                        &= P Q \\
                        &= TR
                    \end{aligned}$$

The marginal revenue is the change in total revenue that results from a
one-unit increase in quantity sold. Effectively,

$$\begin{aligned}
                        MR &= \frac{dTR}{dQ}
                    \end{aligned}$$

Profit Maximizing Condition {#sec:profit_maximizing_condition}
---------------------------

Firms want to maximize their economic profit, so they must decide:

-   How to produce at a minimum cost[^29]

-   What quantity to output

-   Whether to enter or exit a market

A perfectly competitive firm chooses output that maximizes economic
output. Said otherwise, they’re trying to maximize $TR - TC$.

In a perfect competition, since the marginal cost (MC) eventually
increases and the marginal revenue (MR) is constant, we can look for the
point where $\textsc{MR} == \textsc{MC}$.

On a table-like question, find the column that maximizes this profit.

Break-Even and Shut-Down Points {#sec:break_even_and_shut_down_points}
-------------------------------

**Break-Even** points are points where the firm makes zero profit.

When a firm is making an economic loss, it needs to decide to either
exit the market or remain in the market. If it remains in the market, it
must decide to either **shut down** temporarily, or to produce goods.
These decision points will be based on the firm’s economic best
interest. We can say that the economic cost can be tabulated as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
                    \text{Economic loss} &= (\text{Total fixed cost}) + (\text{total variable cost}) - (\text{total revenue}) \\
                    &= \textsc{TFC} + \textsc{Q}(\textsc{AVC}) - \textsc{Q}(\textsc{P})
                \end{aligned}$$

When a firm shuts down, $Q=0$ and the firm still needs to pay the TFC.
Alternatively, if ATC exceeds the price, the loss exceeds the TFC, and
the firm shuts down.

At the shutdown point (i.e. the economic advantage of production is 0),
the firm is indifferent between producing and shutting down.

Market Supply in the Short Run {#sec:market_supply_in_the_short_run}
------------------------------

The short-run market supply curve shows the quantity supplied by all
firms in the market at each price when each firm’s plant and the number
of firms stay the same.

When the supply curve is equal to the AVC, some firms will produce the
shutdown quantity, and others will produce zero. The market is perfectly
elastic.

By increasing the demand[^30], the price and quantity produced
increased. Vice versa holds.

### Profits and Losses in the Short Run {#sub:profits_and_losses_in_the_short_run}

Maximum profit is not always a positive economic profit. Depending on
the value of the marginal cost v.s. the marginal revenue, sometimes the
lowest point on the average total cost curve is sometimes (and sometimes
not) an economically profitable position.

### Profits and Losses in the Long Run

Entry and Exit {#sec:entry_and_exit}
--------------

We’re trying to determine how firms decide to enter/leave the market.

Firms will leave when they incur an economic loss. Firms will enter an
industry when existing firms make an economic profit.

### Entry {#sub:entry}

The entrance of a firm creates an increased market supply, which results
in a reduced market price.

### Exit {#sub:exit}

When firms incur an economic loss, they will leave. This reduces the
market supply, and thus the market price.

Changes in Demand {#sec:changes_in_demand}
-----------------

### Decreasing Demand {#sub:decreasing_demand}

By decreasing demand, the market demand curve shifts leftward. Thus, the
price and quantity decreases.

Since this is now below each firm’s minimum average cost, some firms
incur economic losses. The economic losses cause some firms to exit in
the long run, which decreases the market supply.

As the price rises, the quantity produced by all firms decreases
overall, but each firm makes more individually.

A new equilibrium is formed at the new equal minimum average total cost.

In the initial and new long-run equilibrium, the number of firms in the
market achieving equilibrium is lower.

### Increasing Demand {#sub:increasing_demand}

By increasing demand, the demand curve is shifted rightward. The price
and quantity increases. Due to low barrier, firms enter and increase the
short-run supply. As the supply increases, the price falls, and the
market quantity continues to increase.

Net-net, the only difference between the initial and new long-run
equilibrium is that there are is a larger number of firms producing the
equilibrium quantity in the new equilibrium.

External Economics and Diseconomies {#sec:external_economics_and_diseconomies}
-----------------------------------

External Economics
:   are factors beyond the control of an individual firm that lower the
    firm’s costs as industry output increases.

External Diseconomies
:   are factors beyond the control of an individual firm that raise the
    firm’s costs as industry output increases.

In the absence of the External Economics and Diseconomies, a firm’s cost
remains constant as the market output changes.

In the absence of external economies and external diseconomies, an
increase in demand doesn’t change price.

In the presence of external economies, an increase in demand lowers
prices.

In the presence of external diseconomies, an increase in demand raises
prices.

We call the price curve as demand changes the **long-run market supply
curve**.

New Technologies {#sec:new_technologies}
----------------

New technology always lowers costs. Firms that adopt new tech make an
economic profit.

A new tech enables firms to produce at lower average cost and/or lower
marginal cost. This shifts their cost curves downward.

New tech firms enter, and old tech firms must either adapt or die.

The industry supply increases, and the supply curve shifts rightwards.
The price falls, and the quantity increases.

Eventually, a new long-run equilibrium emerges where all firms use the
new technology.

Efficient Resource Usage {#sec:efficient_resource_usage}
------------------------

Resources are used efficiently when nobody can be made better without
making a someone else becomes worse off.

A consumer’s demand curve shows how the best budget allocation changes
as the price of a good changes. Consumers then get the most value out of
their resources at all points along their demand curves. Without
external benefits, the market demand curve is the marginal social
benefit curve.

A competitive firm’s supply curve shows how the profit-maximizing
quantity changes as the price of a good changes. Firms get the most
value out of their resources at all points along their supply curves.
Without external cost, the market supply curve is the marginal social
cost curve.

Equilibrium and Efficiency {#sec:equilibrium_and_efficiency}
--------------------------

At competitive equilibrium, resources are used efficiently. This means
that the amount demanded is the amount supplied.

The gains from trade for consumers is measured by consumer surplus.

The gains from trade for producers is measured by producer surplus.

Total gains from trade is equal to the total surplus. In the long-run,
the total surplus is maximized.

Monopoly {#cha:monopoly}
========

Monopolies are markets with only one seller but many buyers. Since the
monopoly is the sole producer of a product, the demand curve is the
market demand curve.

A monopoly is a market where:

-   No close substitute exists for a given good or service.

-   Markets have a high barrier to entry.

There are three different types of barriers to entry:

Natural
:   - When economies of scale enable one firm to supply the entire
    market at the lowest possible cost.

Ownership
:   - When one firm owns a significant portion of a key resource.

Legal
:   - When entrance to a market is restricted by a public
    franchise[^31], Government License[^32], a Patent, or a Copyright.

Price-Setting Strategies {#sec:price_setting_strategies}
------------------------

Monopolies set their own price. If a monopoly raises the price, they do
not need to worry about competitors.

Single-Price Monopoly
:   is a firm that must sell each unit for the same price.

Price Discrimination
:   is the practice of variable pricing depending on the customer.

The average revenue (AR) of a monopolist is the market demand curve.

The total revenue (TR) is the price multiplied by the quantity sold
($\textsc{TR} = PQ$) The marginal revenue (MR) is the change in total
revenue that results from a one-unit increase in the quantity sold. For
a single-price monopoly, the marginal revenue is less than the price at
each level of output ($MR < P$).

To sell more, monopolies must set a lower price. When this happens, we
effect the TR by:

-   Lowering the price creates a revenue loss

-   Increasing the quantity increases revenue

A single-price monopoly’s marginal revenue is related to the elasticity
of demand for that good. Elastic demand means that a fall in price
brings an increase in total revenue. Inelastic demand means that a fall
in price brings a decrease in total revenue. If the demand is unit
elastic, a fall in price doesn’t change total revenue.

The total revenue is maximized when the marginal revenue is 0.

In monopolies, demand is always elastic.

Price and Output Decision {#sec:price_and_output_decision}
-------------------------

The monopoly sets the price where they can make the most profit.

A monopoly makes profit when $\textsc{MR} = \textsc{MC}$.

Monopolies may make economic profits in the long run, and ones that
incur economic losses may shut down temporarily in the short run, or
exit the market in the long run.

Compared to perfect competition, monopolies produce a smaller output for
a higher price.

There is no relationship between the quantity supplied and the price
defined by the marginal cost curve, since the price comes from the
market demand curve.

Single-Price Monopoly vs Competition {#sec:single_price_monopoly_vs_competition}
------------------------------------

### Surpluses {#sub:surpluses}

Some of the lost consumer surplus goes to the monopoly as a producer
surplus, but not all of it.

Consumer surplus shrinks since they pay higher prices, and they get less
of the good.

The producer surplus shrinks since the price raise reduces the quantity
sold.

### Rent-Seeking Equilibrium {#sub:rent_seeking_equilibrium}

Any surplus is called **economic rent**, and the act of pursuing this
wealth is called **rent seeking**.

Rent seekers pursue their goals in two ways:

-   Buy a monopoly

-   Create a monopoly

Price Discrimination {#sec:price_discrimination}
--------------------

When different prices are set for different audiences, we call this
**price discrimination**.

To be able to price discriminate, a monopoly must:

-   Identify different buyer types.

    -   Through units of a good, such as quantity discounts.

    -   Among groups of buyers, such as restrictions on airline tickets
        and advance purchasers.

-   Sell a product that cannot be resold.

Firms can increase their profit through price discrimination. **Perfect
price discrimination** occurs if a firm is able to sell each unit at the
highest price anyone is willing to pay[^33].

### Rent Seeking with Price Discrimination {#sub:rent_seeking_with_price_discrimination}

Monopolies that price discriminate better, are more efficient and have
close output to the competitive output.

This is different than perfect competition in two ways:

-   Monopoly captures the entire consumer surplus.

-   Increased economic profit attracts more rent-seeking activities,
    which lead to inefficiencies.

Regulation {#sec:regulation}
----------

Regulations
:   are the rules administrated by government to influence price,
    quantities, entry, etc.

Deregulation
:   is the process of removing regulations.

There are two main theories on how regulation works:

Social Interest Theory
:   is where regulation relentlessly seeks out inefficiency.

Capture Theory
:   is where regulation serves the self-interest of producers, who
    capture regulators.

### Regulating Natural Monopolies {#sub:regulating_natural_monopolies}

When cost and demand create natural monopolies, quantity produced is
less than the efficient quantity.

Governments regulate natural monopolies to fix this by using a
**marginal cost pricing rule** that sets the price equal to the
monopoly’s marginal cost. Since the quantity demanded at the marginal
cost price is the efficient quantity, this works. Comparing price and
output between monopoly and perfect competition

[^1]: This is an optimization problem. I think it’s called the integer
    backpack problem, but our solution **should** work.

[^2]: Ok, duh. That’s obvious.

[^3]: This is usually income inside micro-economics

[^4]: Ok, duh. That’s obvious too.

[^5]: WTF how is this a paradox? Nobody knows, but this is math.
    Anything goes, for the un-initiated and un-thinking public.

[^6]: MRS is measured as the absolute derivative.

[^7]: Think of gum brands.

[^8]: Think of left/right shoes.

[^9]: This is called “inside” the budget line

[^10]: Similarly, this is called “outside” the budget line.

[^11]: i.e. if Burgers are being plotted on the $x$-axis, then only the
    $x$-intercept will be changed.

[^12]: That’s because the two lines must be tangential at this point.
    Check out a graph (not included D: )

[^13]: i.e. barely

[^14]: Wtf, I know.

[^15]: Wtf, I know.

[^16]: Pictorially, this doesn’t make any sense to me. Since when the
    prices change, the budget line rotates, it almost surely must
    intersect a new indifference curve. I suppose if both prices change
    at the same time, this is possible.

[^17]: Make lots of money, work less. Sounds good to me.

[^18]: This is also sometimes called the normal profit.

[^19]: This decision is called the “make-buy” decision.

[^20]: Alternatively, it’s a function that converts labor and capital
    into goods

[^21]: Stockholders of a firm are the principals, and the managers of a
    firm are their agents.

[^22]: This is usually in the form of the paper value of their stock.

[^23]: It took me a while to understand this, but they’re talking about
    how firms can coordinate their production more effectively than
    markets due to the firms individual drive to be increasingly
    efficient. For example, it’s hard for a market to move to outsourced
    production, but individual firms may be able to do this to
    consolidate their dealings with others. Of course, this is expressed
    in four bullet points for reasons that escape me.

[^24]: If an asset has no resale value, the amount paid is a sunk cost.

[^25]: They call these curves. For whatever reason, the words “plot” and
    “graph” are anathema to these people.

[^26]: The phrase “context switch” comes to mind.

[^27]: Obviously

[^28]: What’s an LRAC?

[^29]: It does this by operating with the plant that minimizes LRAC
    (TODO: What is LRAC?)

[^30]: By this, we shift the demand-curve to the right

[^31]: Like the Canada Post

[^32]: Like a license to sell cell-phones, practice engineering, etc.
