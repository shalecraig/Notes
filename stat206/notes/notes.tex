                Empirical Studies are algorithms of the form: \emph{Hypothesi} $\to$ \emph{Data Collection} $\to$ \emph{Analysis}.
                For example, we may ask:
                \begin{quote}
                    Can people tell if vinyl sounds better than MP3?
                \end{quote}
                \begin{description}
                    \item[Unit]\index{unit} is a single element (i.e. model, entity, person, item, etc) of a population whose characteristics we are interested in.
                    \item[Population]\index{population} is the universe of all \emph{Unit}s we are interested in.
                    \item[Variables]\index{variables} are a measurement of the characteristic from a unit.
                \end{description}
                After some class discussion, we change the question to be as follows:
                \begin{quote}
                    Can healthy teens tell if vinyl sounds better than mp3?
                \end{quote}
                In this question, here are the different sections:
                \begin{description}
                    \item[Population] All healthy teens
                    \item[Unit] A single healthy teen
                    \item[Variable 1] Can the Unit correctly identify the recognized type?
                    \item[Variable 2] Which recording did the Unit believe sounds better?
                \end{description}
                We define the following other terms:
                \begin{description}
                    \item[Categorial Variable:]\index{categorial variable} qualitative variable, belongs to $k$ classes or categories.
                    \item[Discrete Variable:]\index{discrete variable} quantitative, countable variable (Integers).
                    \item[Continuous Variable:]\index{continuous variable} quantitative, non-countable (Reals).
                    \item[Sample:]\index{sample} A subset of the population from which measurements are actually made.
                    \item[Sample Error:]\index{sample error} The error introduced by estimating an entire population's characteristics from a \emph{Sample}.
                    \item[Study Error:]\index{study error} A systematic, \emph{unfixable} error through the sample not accurately representing the population.
                \end{description}

                There are these metrics:
                \begin{description}
                    \item[Sample Mean:]\index{mean} $\bar{x} = \sum_{i \in 1}^{n} x_i$.

                        \begin{align*}
                        x^* &= \left\{

                               \frac{x_{\frac{n+1}{2}} + x_{\frac{n+2}{2}}}{2} & : \text{if $n$ is even}
                             \end{array}
                           \right.
                    \end{align*}
                    \item[Sample Variance:]\index{variance}\index{dispersion}\index{s!s2@$s^2$} $s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$
                    \item[Standard Deviation:]\index{standard deviation}\index{s@$s$} $s = \sqrt{s^2}$
                    \item[Range:] $x_n - x_1$ (max - min)
                \end{description}

                There are two different kinds of Statistics:
                \begin{description}
                    \item[Descriptive Statistics]\index{descriptive statistics} is summarizing data from a sample both graphically and numerically.
                    \item[Inferential Statistics]\index{inferential statistics} uses a sample to generalize results to the entire population.

            \section{Probability} % (fold)
            \label{sec:probability}
                Classic probability is usually defined as:
                \begin{align*}
                    \frac{\text{Number of ways event can occur}}{\text{Total number of equally likely outcomes}}
                \end{align*}

                \begin{description}
                    \item[Relative Frequency:]\index{relative frequency} the proportion of times outcome occurs as a number of trials approaches infinity.
                    \item[Subjective Frequency:]\index{subjective frequency} estimates of probability based on subjective opinion.
                    \item[Experiment:]\index{experiment} is a repeatable phenomenon
                    \item[Trial:]\index{trial} is a single instance of an experiment
                    \item[Sample Space:]\index{sample space} is the set of distinct outcomes for an experiment or process where only one outcome of the set occurs
                        \begin{description}
                            \item[Discrete] sample spaces have countable number of simple event
                            \item[Non-Discrete/Continuous] sample spaces have a non-countable number of simple events
                        \end{description}

                \subsection{Probability Models} % (fold)
                \label{sub:probability_models}
                    \begin{align*}
                        (\forall A) & (0 \le P(A) \le 1)
                    \end{align*}
                    If $A$ and $B$ are \emph{mutually exclusive} events, then:
                    \begin{align*}
                        P(A \cup B) &= P(A) + P(B)
                    \end{align*}

                    The distribution for finite sample space $S = \{ a_1, a_2, a_3, \cdots, a_n \}$ and $P(a_i) = \frac{1}{n}$ is named \emph{uniform distribution}.

                    Permutations are ordered choices:
                    \begin{align*}
                        n^{(r)} &= \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}
                    \end{align*}
                    Remember: $0! = 1$

                    Combinations are unordered choices:
                    \begin{align*}
                        \dbinom{n}{r} &= \frac{n!}{r! (n - r)!} \\
                        &= \dbinom{n}{(n - r)} \\
                        &= \dbinom{n-1}{r} + \dbinom{n-1}{r-1} \text{ (Pascal's Rule)}
                    \end{align*}
                    \ex
                    4 digits are selected at random, without replacement from $\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \}$ to create a number.
                    What is the probability of:

                    \begin{itemize}

                            Restriction: first digit is not a zero.

                            Let's enumerate the digits:
                            \begin{enumerate}
                                \item 9
                                \item 9
                                \item 8
                                \item 7
                            \end{enumerate}
                            Number of combinations is $9 x 9^{(3)}$.

                            Divide by the size of the sample space to get $P(A) = \frac{9 x 9^{(3)}}{10^{(4)}}$
                        \item `a 4-digit even number is generated'

                    Two events are said to be independent if and only if (iff):

                        P(AB) &= P(A) P(B)
                    \end{align*}
                    With this knowledge, we know the following:
                    \begin{align*}
                        P(A|B) &= P(A) \\

                    \end{align*}

                    \ex Suppose we have 3 events: $A$, $B$, $C$.
                    We know that $P(A) = 0.3$, $P(\bar{C}) = 0.25$, $P(A \cup B) = 0.65$, $P(B \cup \bar{C}) = 0.45$, and that $A$ and $C$ are independent and that $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive.

                    We want to find:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item $P(B)$
                        \item $P(A \cup C)$

                        \item $P(B | \bar{C})$
                    \end{itemize}
                    We have:

                \subsection{Law of Total Probability} % (fold)
                \label{sub:law_of_total_probability}
                    For events that form a complete cover of the sample space (with no ``overlap''), we know this identity:
                    \begin{align*}
                        P(B_iB_j) = 0 &\iff i \ne j \\
                        \cup_{i \in \{ 1, \cdots n \}} B_i &= S \\
                        P (A) &= \sum_{i = 1}^{k} P(A | B_i) P(B_i)
                    \end{align*}
                    In other words, given that $B_k$ is mutually exclusive with $B_j$ for any unequal $k$ and $j$, then $P(A)$ is equal to the sum of $P(A|B_j)$ multiplied by the probability that $P(B_j)$ occurs.

                    \ex A game is played by first rolling a 6-sided die and then flipping a fair coin the number of times shown on the die.
                    What is the probability that at least one head is flipped?

                    Let $A$ be the event that at least $1$ head is flipped.
                    Let $B_i$ be the event that we roll a $1$, where $i = \{ 1, 2, \cdots, 6 \}$.
                    Also, we know that $\bar{A}$ is ``no heads''.

                    \begin{align*}
                        P(\bar{A}) &= \sum_{i = 1}^6 P(\bar{A}|B_i) P(B_i) \\
                                   &= \sum_{i = 1}^6 \frac{1}{6} \frac{1}{2^i} \\
                                   &= \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i = 1}^6 \frac{1}{2^i} \\
                    \end{align*}
                    We can reduce this through the finite geometric series to $P(\bar{A}) = \frac{63}{384}$.
                    We get $P(A) = 1 - P(\bar{A}) = 0.84$.\footnote{

                        It's not far from this to see that $\lim_{n\to \infty} S_n = \frac{1}{1-r}$ if $|r| < 1$.

                    \ex Tests used to diagnose medical conditions are often imperfect, and give false positive or false negative results.
                    A fairly cheap blood test for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has the following characteristics: the false negative rate is 2\% and the false positive rate is 0.5\%.
                    Previous studies estimate that around .04\% of Canadian males are infected with HIV.
                    What is the probability that a Canadian male who tests positive for HIV, actually has the virus?

                    Let $T$ be the event that a randomly selected male tests positive.
                    Let $H$ be the event that a randomly selected male actually has the virus.

                    A \emph{False negative}\index{false negative} is:
                    Given that you do have the virus, the probability that the test tells you don't, is the false negative.

                    We know:
                    \begin{align*}
                        P(H) &= 0.0004 \\

                    The \textbf{variance}\index{variance} ($Var(X)$ or $\sigma^2$) of a random variable $X$ is the expected squared difference from the mean.
                    \begin{align*}

                        &= E(X^2) - E(X)^2
                    \end{align*}
                    We can derive this as follows:
                    \begin{align*}
                        Var(X) &= E\left( (X - E(X))^2 \right) \\

                        &= E(X^2 - E(2E(X)X) + E(E(X)^2)) \\
                        &= E(X^2) - E(2 \mu X) + E(\mu^2) \\
                        &= E(X^2) - 2 \mu E(X) + \mu^2 \\
                        &= E(X^2) - 2\mu^2 + \mu^2 \\
                        &= E(X^2) - \mu^2 \\
                        &= E(X^2) - E(X)^2
                    \end{align*}
                    Where $E(X^2) = \sum_x x^2 f(x)$.

                    \label{ssub:example}
                        We can show this with an example about winning the lottery.

                        Suppose $X$ is the winnings on the lottery, and $R(X) = \{ 0, 20, 300 \}$.

                        \begin{align*}
                            P(X = 300) &= \frac{1}{ {12 \choose 3}} \\
                            &= \frac{1}{220} \\
                            P(X = 20) &= \frac{{3 \choose 2} {9 \choose 1}}{{12 \choose 3}} \\
                            &= \frac{27}{220} \\
                            P(X = 0) &= 1 - P(X = 300) - P(X = 20) \\
                            &= \frac{192}{220}
                        \end{align*}

                        Continuing this example, we can derive expected (average) value of $X$:
                        \begin{align*}
                            \mu_X &= E(X) \\
                            &= \sum_{x \in R(R)} x f(x) \\
                            &= \ldots \\
                            &= 3.8181
                        \end{align*}
                        We can also calculate the variance of the random variable:
                        \begin{align*}
                            Var(X) &= E(X^2) - E(X)^2 \\
                            &= 458.6033- 3.8181^2 \\
                            &= 443.6033
                        \end{align*}

                        We also know that the standard deviation $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{Var(X)}$\index{standard deviation}.

                Let $X$ be the number of successes obtained from $n$ Bernoulli trials, then $X$ follows a Binomial distribution $X \sim Bino(n, p)$.
                \begin{align*}

            \label{sec:poisson_distribution}
                The Poisson Distribution\index{Poisson Distribution} (or Poisson Process\index{Poisson Process|see{Poisson Distribution}}) describes a process where we have guaranteed individuality (that events are guaranteed to occur at unique times), and homogeneity (events occur at a uniform rate\footnote{This rate $\lambda$ can be assumed to be correct.} $\lambda$).

                When events occur with an average rate of $\lambda$ per unit of time, we use the random variable $X$ to represent the number of events which occur in $t$ units of time, then $X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda, t)$.
                We then have:
                \begin{align*}
                    f(x) &= \frac{e^{-\lambda t} (\lambda t)^x}{x!} \\
                    E(X) &= \lambda t \\
                    Var(x) &= \lambda t

                    Suppose that 911 calls follow a Poisson process with an average of 3 calls per minute. Find the probability there will be:

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item 6 calls in the next 2.5 minutes

                    Start with the first one:

                    Basically, we have:TODO: complete this.

                When we have two distinct object types of $N$ objects totaling $r$ successes and $N - r$ failures, we sample $n$ objects without repetition.

                % TODO: flesh out this description/concept more. It's very vague.
                For $X \sim Hyper(N, r, n)$, where $R(X) = \{  0, \ldots, \min(r, n) \}$, we have:
                \begin{align*}
                    f(x) &= \frac{{r \choose x} {N - r \choose n - x}}{{N \choose n}} \\

            \label{sec:geometric_distribution}
                When we have repeated Bernoulli trials(see Section~\ref{sec:bernoulli_distribution}) until success, we can define the value of the random variable $X$ as $X \sim Geometric(p)$, where $p$ is the probability of success.

                \begin{align*}
                    R(X) &= \{1, \ldots \} \\
                    f(x) &= p(1 - p)^{x - 1} \\
                    E(X) &+ \frac{1}{p} \\
                    Var(X) &= \frac{1 - p}{p^2} \\
                    P(X \le x) &= 1 - P(X > x) \\
                        &= 1 - (1 - p)^x
                \end{align*}
                Conceptually, we can describe this as $X$ is the number of trials until the first success.
                In a string of \verb|ffft|\footnote{This is the case of three failures then a success.}, we have $P(X = 4) = (1-p)(1-p)(1-p)p$.

                    Since every play is an (almost) unrelated Bernoulli trial, and $X \sim Geometric(1/6)$, we can determine the some statistics on prizes.
                    \begin{align*}
                        P(X = 10) &= p(1-p)^9 \\
                        &= \frac{1}{6} (\frac{5}{6})^9 \\
                        &= 0.03 \\
                        E(X) &= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{6}} \\
                        &= 6

            \label{sec:continuous_sample_space}
                We want to determine the probability of an event occurring in a sample space on intervals $(a, b)$.
                In equally likely events, the probability of being in the interval is proportional to the length of the interval.

                We use the notation $P((a, b))$ to denote the probability that the events occur in the interval.

                \ex

                Given that $P(S) = P((0, 200)) = 1$, and $0 \le a < b \le 200$, we can say:
                \begin{align*}
                    P((a, b)) &= \frac{b - a}{200}
                \end{align*}
                Similarly, given $0 \le a < b < c < d$, we can say:
                \begin{align*}
                    P( (a, b) \cup (c, d)) &= \frac{(b - a) + (d - c)}{200}

            \section{Continuous Random Variables} % (fold)
            \label{sec:continuous_random_variables}
                A random variable $X$ is a function from the sample space $S$ to real numbers $X : S \to \mathbb{R}$.
                Given that the range of $X$ is represented as $R(X)$ is continuous, then individual elements $x \in R(X)$ must have $0$ probability:
                \begin{align*}
                    P(X = x) &= 0 \\
                    P(a \le X \le b) &= P(a < X < b)
                \end{align*}

                \ex

                We have a few examples of continuous random variables:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Radius of a dart from the center of a dart board.
                    \item Height of a randomly selected person\footnote{No, this doesn't need to be random}.
                    \item Time between events during a Poisson process.
                    \item Age of a randomly selected person\footnote{No, this doesn't need to be random}.

            \label{sec:probability_density_function_pdf}
                The probability density function\index{Probability Density Function} (pdf\index{pdf|see{Probability Density Function}}) of a continuous random variable $X$ denoted $f_X(x)$ describes the probability that $X$ takes on the value in an interval $(a, b) \in R(X)$.
                \begin{align*}
                    \int_a^b f(x) dx &= P(a < X < b)
                \end{align*}
                Proper PDFs on an interval $(a, b)$ require $\int_a^b f(x) dx = 1$ and $f(x) \ge 0$.

                    What is the size of each interval if I preak $(0, 10)$ into $N$ equal intervals?

                    \begin{align*}
                        \text{length} &= \Delta x \\
                        &= \frac{10}{N} \\
                        P(0 < X < 10) &= P(0 < X < 5) + P(5 < X < 10) \\
                        &= \sum_{i=1}^{10} P(i - 1 < X < i) \\
                        &= \sum_{i=1}^{10} \frac{i - (i - 1)}{200} \\
                        &= \sum_{x=1}^{10} \frac{1}{200} \\
                        &= \frac{10}{200} \\

            \label{sec:expected_value}
                The \textbf{mean} or \textbf{expected value} of a continuous random variable $X$ is defined as:
                \begin{align*}

                For given real numbers $a$ and $b$, random variables $X$ and $Y$, and a function $g(x)$, these two properties hold:
                \begin{align*}

            \label{sec:variance}
                Variance is the expected difference from the mean:

                    Var(X) &= E((X - E(X)^2)) \\

                \end{align*}
                Given that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent random variables, and $a , b \in \mathbb{R}$:
                \begin{align*}
                    Var(a X_1 + b X_2) &= a^2 Var(X_1) + b^2 Var(X_2)

            \section{Uniform Distribution} % (fold)
            \label{sec:uniform_distribution}
                In a Uniform Distribution\index{Uniform Distribution!continuous}, the probability of any subinterval of the range is proportional to the length of the interval.
                Any two sub-intervals of the same length have the same probability.

                For $a < b$, if $X$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $(a, b)$, then we write $X \sim Unif(a, b)$:
                \begin{align*}
                    f(x) &= \frac{1}{b - a} \\
                \end{align*}

                For the uniform distribution, we know:
                \begin{align*}
                    E(X) &= \frac{b + a}{2} \\
                    Var(X) &= \frac{(b - a)^2}{12}
                \end{align*}

                \label{ssub:example_1}
                    A factory makes 60cm shoelaces.
                    While they are all between 58-62cm, they are required to be between 59-61.5cm.

                    Let $X$ be the length of randomly cut shoelace $X \sim Unif(58, 62)$ ($b = 62$, $a = 58$).
                    Then we have that:
                    \begin{align*}
                        P(X = 60) &= 0 \\
                        f(x) &= \frac{1}{b-a} \\
                        &= \frac{1}{4} \\
                        P(59 < X < 61.5) &= \int_{59}^{61.5} f(x)dx \\
                        &= \int_{59}^{61.5} \frac{1}{4}dx \\
                        &= \left. \frac{1}{4} \right|_{59}^{61.5} \\
                        &= \frac{2.5}{4}
                    \end{align*}
                    Let $Y$ be the number of shoelaces meeting the specifications.
                    We know that $Y$ is approximated as $Y \sim Bin(n = 100, p = \frac{2.5}{4})$.

            \label{sec:exponential_distribution}
                This describes situations where events occur according to a Poisson process, and we measure the inter-arrival times between events.

                If $X$ is the amount of time until the next event in a Poisson process, then $X \sim Exp(\theta)$:
                \begin{align*}
                    f(x) &= \frac{1}{\theta} e^{\frac{-x}{\theta}} \text{, for $x > 0$} \\
                    F(x) &= 1 - e^{\frac{-x}{\theta}} \\
                    E(X) &= \theta \\
                    Var(X) &= \theta^2
                \end{align*}

                    Let $X$ be the time until a light bulb burns out (in days) where the number of burnouts is 1 every 7 days.

                    Since the frequency is $\frac{1}{7}$, we know that the period, $\theta$ is $7$.

                    We can say that $X \sim Exp(\theta = 7)$

                    \begin{align*}
                        P(X = 2) &= 0 \\
                        P(X > 30.5) &= \int_{30.5}^\infty f(x)dx \\
                        &= \int_{30.5}^\infty \frac{1}{7} e^{\frac{-x}{7}}dx \\
                        &= \left. -e^{\frac{-x}{7}} \right|_{30.5}^\infty \\
                        &= e^{\frac{-30.5}{7}} \\
                        &= 0.0128 \\
                        P(X < 1) &= \int_0^1 \frac{1}{7}  e^{\frac{-x}{7}} dx \\
                        &= 0.1331

                Suppose $X \sim Bin(3, 0, 7)$.
                Then $f(x) = {3 \choose x} 0.7^x (1-0.7)^{3-x}$.
                As usual, if we define $F(x) = \sum_{i=0}^x f(i)$, we can build a table of different ranges of $F(x)$.
                By picking random numbers, we can determine which range they fall in and then back-trace to see what the corresponding $x$-value is.

        \label{cha:normal_distribution}
            We say that random variable $X$ has normal distribution $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ if the pdf has the form:
            \begin{align*}
                f(x) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{\frac{-1}{2} \left( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^2}, x \in \mathbb{R} \\
                E(X) &= \mu \\
                Var(X) &= \sigma^2
            \end{align*}
            This type of distribution comes up in many different places, this is the \textsc{bell curve} shape.

                \begin{align*}
                    Y &= aX_1 + bX_2 + c \\
                    Y &\sim N(a \mu_1 + b \mu_2 + c, a^2\sigma_1^2 + b^2 \sigma_2^2)

                    What is the probability that they have a mark greater than 80\%?

                    In other words, we're looking for $P(X > 0.8)$:
                    \begin{align*}
                        P(X > 0.8) &= P(X - 0.75 > 0.8 - 0.75) \\
                        Z \sim N(0, 1) &= P\left(\frac{X - 0.75}{0.07} > \frac{0.8 - 0.75}{0.07}\right) \\
                        &= P\left(Z > \frac{0.05}{0.07}\right) \\

                    What's the probability that a randomly selected student has a mark less than $60$?
                    \begin{align*}
                        P(X < 0.6) &= P\left(\frac{X-0.75}{0.07} < \frac{0.6-0.75}{0.07}\right) \\

                The density of a normal $f(x)$ is not integrable for finite limits $a, b$.
                We need to look this up in Normal Distribution Tables, one of which is available in Appendix~\ref{cha:normal_distribution_table}.

            \label{sec:independent_normal_variables}
                Let $X$ be the amount of time that it takes $A$ to do an action, and let $Y$ be the amount of time that it takes $B$ to do an independent action.

                We have $X \sim N(50, 100)$ and $Y \sim N(52, 64)$.

                By the linearity property, we define $Z = X - Y$:
                \begin{align*}
                    Z &\sim N(50 - 52, \sqrt{100}^2 + \sqrt{64}^2) \\
                    &= N(-2, 164)
                \end{align*}

                Now can start to solve equations like $P(X < Y)$:
                \begin{align*}
                    P(X < Y) &= P(X - Y < 0) \\
                    &= P(\frac{X - Y - (-2)}{\sqrt{164}} < \frac{0 - (-2)}{\sqrt{164}}) \\
                    &= P(Z < \frac{2}{\sqrt{164}}) \\
                    &= P(Z < 0.16) \\
                    &= 0.5636

            \label{sec:many_independent_normal_variables}
                Let the random variable $X_i$ represent the price of the $i^{\text{th}}$ painting, where all $X_i$ are independent of $X_j$.
                Let the random variable $Y$ represent the monthly total of all paintings sold.

                \begin{align*}
                    Y &= X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_10 \\
                    &= \sum_{i=1}^{10} X_i
                \end{align*}
                We can say that $X_i \sim N(200, 200^2)$.
                Thus we can use by the variables independence that:
                \begin{align*}
                    Var(Y) &= Var\left(\sum_i X_i\right) \\
                    &= \sum_i Var(X_i) \\
                    &= 400 000
                \end{align*}
                We can also say that the expected value is\footnote{This ``unwrapping'' operation can always be done.}:
                \begin{align*}
                    E(Y) &= E\left(\sum_i X_i\right) \\
                    &= \sum_i E(X_i) \\
                    &= 2000
                \end{align*}
                Thus, $Y \sim N(2000, (10) 200^2)$.

            \label{sec:binomial_approximation}
                For large $n$, we can approximate the distribution of samples using a binomial method.

                Specifically, if $np > 5$ and $n (1 - p) > 5$ (i.e. $n$ is large and $0 < p < 1$)\footnote{These seem so arbitrary to me. No reason for the number 5 was presented in class.}.
                Suppose $X \sim Bin(n, p)$.
                Then we define the random variable $Z$ expressed in terms of $n$ and $p$ as:
                \begin{align*}
                    Z &= \frac{X - np}{\sqrt{np (1 - p)}} \\
                    &\sim N(0, 1) \\
                    E(Z) &= np \\
                    Var(Z) &= np(1-p)
                \end{align*}

                Since we are using a continuous distribution to approximate the discrete Binomial distribution, we need to correct some continuities at edges of the distributions:
                \begin{align*}
                    P(a < X) &\approx P\left( \frac{(a + 0.5) - np}{\sqrt{np(1 - p)}} < Z \right) \\
                    P(X < b) &\approx P\left( \frac{(b - 0.5) - np}{\sqrt{np(1 - p)}} > Z \right) \\
                \end{align*}
                \subsubsection{Example 1} % (fold)
                \label{ssub:example_1}
                    Suppose we have a random variable $X$ defined as $X \sim Bin(200, 0.3$.
                    What is $P(X < 50)$?

                    Well, we have $np = 60$, $np (1-p) = 42$.
                    Since $np > 5$ and $np (1-p) > 5$, we can use the normal approximation!

                    \begin{align*}
                        P(X < 50) &= P(X < 50.5) \\
                        &= P(\frac{X - 60}{\sqrt{np (1 - p)}} < \frac{50.5 - 60}{\sqrt{np (1 - p)}}) \\
                        &= P(Z < \frac{-9.5}{\sqrt{np(1 - p)}}) \\
                        &= P(Z < - 1.47) \\
                        &= 1 - P (Z < 1.47) \\
                        &= 0.0708
                    \end{align*}
                    Similarly:
                    \begin{align*}
                        P(X > 80) &= P(X > 79.5) \\
                        &= P(\frac{X - 60}{\sqrt{np (1 - p)}} > \frac{79.5 - 60}{\sqrt{np (1 - p)}}) \\
                        &= P(Z > 3.0) \\
                        &= 1 - P(Z < 3.0) \\
                        &= 0.0013

                    Let $X$ be the point-value of a random card.
                    Naturally, $R(X) = \{ 2, \ldots, 10, 11 \}$.

                            $X$ & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\ \hline \hline
                            $f(x)$ & $\frac{1}{13}$ & $\frac{1}{13}$ & $\frac{1}{13}$ & $\frac{1}{13}$ & $\frac{1}{13}$ & $\frac{1}{13} $& $\frac{1}{13}$ & $\frac{1}{13}$ & $\frac{4}{13}$ & $\frac{1}{13}$ \\ \hline

                        \end{tabular}
                    \end{table}

                    If we find $F^{-1}(u)$, we can generate these card values with even probability.

        \label{cha:sampling_distribution}
            We want to be able to draw statistical conclusions about a \textbf{population}.
            We are limited to a sample because we do not have resources available to adequately measure the entire population.
            By wisely selecting a \textbf{sample} of the population, and measuring the \textbf{variable} interest, we try to build statistical conclusions with reasonable confidence.
            We use \textbf{random sampling} to ensure the sample accurately represents the population.

            \textbf{Statistics} are functions of the random sample (RS) which are used to learn about model parameters.

            Since sampling is random, the statistics representing them are semi-random as well.
            We describe this randomness using a \textbf{sampling distribution}.
            \section{Simple Random Sampling (SRS)} % (fold)
            \label{sec:simple_random_sampling_srs}
                Simple random sampling is the most basic form of random sampling.
                It involves querying each unit in the population with an equal probability.
            % section simple_random_sampling_srs (end)
            \section{Stratified Random Sampling} % (fold)
            \label{sec:stratified_random_sampling}
                With simple random sampling, we divide a population of size $N$ into $K$ distinct buckets\footnote{We can call these buckets strata.}, each with $N_i$ items\footnote{$N_i$ doesn't need to be the same for all $i$.} ($i = 1 \ldots K$)

                We then take a simple random sample of size $n_i$ from each strata such that:
                \begin{align*}
                    n &= \sum_{i=1}^K n_i
                \end{align*}
                We can select $n_i$ using a few different methods:
                \begin{description}
                    \item[Equal Allocation] sets $n_i = \frac{N}{K}$ - all strata have equally sized queries.
                    \item[Proportional Allocation] sets $n_i = \frac{n N_i}{K}$ - all stratas have queries proportional to their size.
                    \item[Optimal (Neyman) Allocation] is where each sample is weighted by the strata variance.
                \end{description}
                In stratified sampling, we have increased benefit over simple random sampling when groups are more distinct.
                This ensures all groups are represented in the sample.

            \section{Cluster Sampling} % (fold)
            \label{sec:cluster_sampling}
                When a population is divided into $M$ natural clusters that are each justifiably a microcosm of the entire population, and a simple random sample of $m$ clusters is selected.
                From each selected cluster, a simple random sample of size $n_i = \frac{n}{m}$ is taken.

                By only selecting a few clusters, we reduce data acquisition cost, which makes this economically efficient compared to a simple random sampling.

                A few examples:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item High-school students would have strata by grade with clusters in every school.
                    \item Voters in federal election would cluster by city or by riding.
                    \item UW Students can be arranged into strata by faculty.

            \label{sec:probability_distributions}

                A random sample of size $n$ is taken from an infinite population, it is a set of independent and identically distributed (\textsc{iid}) random variables $\{ X_1, \ldots, X_n \}$.

                Where each random variable has the same probability distribution $f_i(x)$, mean $\mu_i$ and variance $\sigma^2$, we can get these statistics:
                \begin{align*}
                    T &= h(X_1, \ldots, X_n) \\
                    \bar{X} &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\
                    S^2 &= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \\
                    X_{(1)} &= \min_i (X_i)
                \end{align*}
                Where $T$ is [unknown], % TODO: what is $T$?
                $\bar{X}$ is the mean,
                $S^2$ is the standard deviation,
                and $X_{(1)}$ is the minimum. % TODO: what is $X_{(1)}$?

                The sampling distribution of a statistic represents the probability distribution which describes the randomness of the statistic.

                    Take a simple random sampling of size $n = 3$.
                    We define $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$.

                    The sample mean is also a random variable $\bar{X} = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3}{3}$.

                    Given $x_1 = 7$, $x_2 = 8$, $x_3 = 8.5$, we have $X_{(1)} = 7$, $\bar{x} = \frac{23.5}{3}$, and $S^2 = 0.58$.

                    $X_i \sim Exp(\theta = 7)$ for $i \in [1, 40]$.
                    The light-bulbs have a $\lambda = \frac{1}{7\text{ days}}$.

                An appropriate probability model is selected for the experiment.

                Given that the probability function for $X_i$ depends on an unknown parameter $\hat{\theta}$, an estimator of $\theta$ is a statistic defined as a function of the random sample:
                \begin{align*}
                    \hat{\theta} &= h(X_1, \ldots, X_n)

                \label{sub:confidence_interval}
                    We can define the probability $\alpha$ as the probability that a random interval doesn't contain the true value of the parameter.

                    Then $(1- \alpha)\%$ is the confidence in an interval for a parameter $\theta$.
                    This confidence is calculated by observing a random interval $(L(X), U(X))$ such that:
                    \begin{align*}
                        P(L(X) < \theta < U(X)) &= 1 - \alpha
                    \end{align*}
                    It's important that this ends on the interval $(L(X), U(X))$ which are random.

                    We generally set $L(X)$ and $U(X)$, then observe the value of the parameter over the interval.

                    After observing the interval $L(X)$ and $U(X)$, our confidence of the interval is $1-\alpha$.

                        \mu &= \bar{x} \pm z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \frac{\sigma_0}{\sqrt{n}}
                    \end{align*}
                    Where $z_\alpha$ is the $\alpha$-quantile - a value such that $P(Z < z_\alpha) = \alpha$.

                    The \textbf{margin of error} for the confidence interval is the distance between the point estimated and the ends of the interval.
                    It's effectively measured by how ``off'' a confidence interval can be.
                    In the $1-\alpha$ case a few lines prior, the confidence interval is:
                    \begin{align*}
                        z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \frac{\sigma_0}{\sqrt{n}}
                    \end{align*}

                    It is important to note that when solving for a size $n$ that gives a requested confidence interval, it is important to round up (and be over-precise) than to round down (and be under-precise).

                    \subsubsection{Example 1} % (fold)
                    \label{ssub:example_1}
                        Suppose we have $\sigma_0^2 = 1 500 000$, and want a 95\% confidence interval.
                        We have measured $\bar{x} = 70 000$ across $n = 100$ samples.

                        Since $1 - \alpha = .95$, we must have $\alpha = 0.05$.

                        Then we have $z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} = z_{0.95}$.
                        Plugging into $P(Z < z_{0.95}) = 0.95$, we get $z_{0.95} = 1.645$.

                        We have the margin of error as $1.645 \sqrt{\frac{1 500 000}{100}} = 201.47$.

                        That means that a 90\% confidence interval for the measured variable is given by $(70 000 - 201.97, 70 000 + 201.97) = (69798.03, 70201.97)$.

                \label{sub:binomial_confidence_interval}
                    When $X_i \sim Bin(n, p)$\footnote{My notes say when $X \sim Bernoulli(p)$ as well, which makes sense since Binomial distributions are just repeated Bernoulli trials.}, we know that $E(X_i) = p$ and the variance is $Var(X_i) = p(1 - p)$.

                    We can estimate the probability of success as:
                    \begin{align*}
                        \hat{p} &= \frac{X}{n} \\
                        &= \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n} \\
                        &= \bar{\alpha} \\
                        \implies E(\hat{p}) &= p \\
                        Var(\hat{p}) &= \frac{Var(X_i)}{n} \\
                        &= \frac{p(1-p)}{n}
                    \end{align*}

                    Using the binomial approximation, if $n\hat{p} > 5$ and $n (1 - \hat{p}) > 5$, then by the central limit theorem (see Section~\ref{sec:central_limit_theorem}):
                    \begin{align*}
                        Z &= \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{p (1 - p) / n}} \\
                        &\sim N(0, 1)
                    \end{align*}
                    An approximate $(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for the percentage $p$ is given by:
                    \begin{align*}
                        \hat{p} \pm z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}
                    \end{align*}

                    \subsubsection{Example 1} % (fold)
                    \label{ssub:example_1}
                        Given that $X = 18$ students prefer smarties over M\&Ms out of the $n = 87$ asked, and we want to have $\alpha = 0.1$, we have:
                        \begin{align*}
                            \hat{p} &= \frac{18}{87} \\
                            &= 0.2
                        \end{align*}
                        Solving for $z_{\ldots}$:
                        \begin{align*}
                            z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} &= z_{0.95} \\
                            &= 1.645
                        \end{align*}
                        Thus, our bounds of $p$ within $\alpha = 1$ is:
                        \begin{align*}
                            p &\in (0.2 - 1.645 \sqrt{\frac{(0.2)(0.8)}{87}}, 0.2 + 1.645 \sqrt{\frac{(0.2)(0.8)}{87}}) \\
                            &= (13, 27)
                        \end{align*}
                        Thus $(13, 27)$\% of students prefer smarties over M\&Ms.

            \label{sec:chi_squared_distribution}
                If $X_1, \ldots, X_k$ are independent, standard normal random variables $\sim N(0, 1)$, then the sum of their squares $Q = \sum_{i=1}^k Z_i^2$ is distributed according to the chi-squared distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom:
                \begin{align*}
                    Q &\sim \chi^2[k]
                \end{align*}
                Since the pdf of $\chi^2[k]$ is not integrable, we use the $\chi^2$ table to calculate probabilities.
                See Appendix~\ref{cha:chi_squared_table} for the table.

                When $R \sim \chi^2[n]$, then:
                \begin{align*}
                    E(R) &= n \\
                    Var(R) &= 2n
                \end{align*}
                If $R_1 \sim \chi^2[n_1]$ is independent of $R_2 \sim \chi^2[n_2]$, then:
                \begin{align*}
                    R_1 + R_2 \sim \chi^2[n_1 + n_2]
                \end{align*}
                That is, the sum of two random independent variables is equal to the sum of their probability distribution functions.

                 For $S^2$ is independent of $\bar{X}$, we have:
                 \begin{align*}
                     \frac{(n-1) S^2}{\sigma^2} &\sim \chi^2[n-1]

                Using $\chi^2$ distributions, we can help find the variance in a distribution.

                For a normally distributed iid with $X_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ of size $n$, we have:

                The Pivotal Quantity:
                \begin{align*}
                    \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} &\sim \chi^2[n - 1]

                A $(1 - \alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $\sigma^2$ is given by:
                \begin{align*}
                    \sigma^2 &=
                    \left(

                    In a public transit system, we have $n = 50$, $\bar{x} = 44$, $s^2 = 25$ and a $\alpha$ specified as $0.05$.

                    Let $X_i$ be the time it takes the $i$th person to commute. Assume $X_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$.

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Find $(1 - \alpha) = 95\%$ confidence interval for $\mu$, the mean commute time:

                            \begin{align*}

                            Thus, a 95\% confidence interval for $\mu$ is $(42.58, 45.42)$.
                        \item Find a $(1 - \alpha) = 95\%$ confidence interval for commute time variance:

                Suppose that $E(X_i) = \mu_X$, $Var(X_i) = \sigma_X^2$, $E(Y_i) = \mu_Y$, and $Var(Y_i) = \sigma_Y^2$.

                By central limit theorem, the pivotal quantity is (for large $n_X$, $n_Y$):
                \begin{align*}
                    Z = \frac{(\bar{X} - \bar{Y}) - (\mu_X - \mu_Y)}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{n_Y}}}
                    &\sim N(0, 1)
                \end{align*}

                An approximate $(1 - \alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $\mu_X - \mu_Y$ is:
                \begin{align*}
                    \mu_X - \mu_Y &= (\bar{x} - \bar{y}) \pm z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{\sigma_Y^2}{n_Y}}
                \end{align*}
                % TODO: go through an example of this.

            \section{Summary} % (fold)
            \label{sec:summary}
                For $X_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$:

                \begin{align*}
                    % TODO are these from?
                    \mu &= \bar{x} \pm t_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} [n-1] \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \\
                    \sigma^2 &=
                        \left(
                            \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}^2 [n - 1]},
                            \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}^2 [n - 1]}
                        \right)
                \end{align*}

                For $X_i \sim N(\mu_X, \sigma^2_X)$, $Y_i \sim N(\mu_Y, \sigma^2_Y)$:

                Define $s_d$ as the standard deviation of the difference of two means,

                For paired (dependent) observations:
                \begin{align*}
                    \mu_d &= \mu_X - \mu_Y \\
                    &= (\bar{x} - \bar(y)) \pm t_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} [n - 1] \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}
                \end{align*}

                With large sample sizes, we can use the central limit theorem to show the distribution.
                We can also estimate the standard error this way.
                % TODO: wtf is Confidence intervals II last slide talking about?

                We can get the approximate $(1 - \alpha)\%$ confidence interval for binomial proportions:
                \begin{align*}
                    \hat{p} \pm z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}
                \end{align*}
                We can get the approximate confidence interval for the difference between two means:
                \begin{align*}
                    \mu_X - \mu_Y &= (\bar{x} - \bar{y}) \pm z_{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{S_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{S_Y^2}{n_Y}}
                \end{align*}
